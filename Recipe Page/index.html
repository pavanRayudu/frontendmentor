        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
            salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon
            of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Heat the pan:</span>
            Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Cook the omelette:</span>
            Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the
            pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Add fillings (optional):</span>
            When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny
            in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the
            omelette.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Fold and serve:</span>
            As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold
            it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it
            onto a plate.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Enjoy:</span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if
            needed.
          </li>
